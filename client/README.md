# Zappy - Graphical Client

## Introduction

This is the graphical client of the Zappy project. It is written in C++ with the Raylib library for Graphical User Interface.

The aim of this part of the project is to provide a graphical interface to the user in order to play the game.


## How to execute the client

### Requirements

- Have the server running in order to connect to it when you play

### Execution

- Run the client with the following command:
```
./zappy_gui -p <port> -h <hostname>

-p port number
-h name of the host machine
```

> :bulb: The port must be the same as the one used by the server and between 1 and 65535, and you may need root privileges to use a port below 1024.

#### Example

```
Server : ./zappy_server -p 4242 -x 10 -y 10 -n team1 team2 -c 2 -f 10
Graphical : ./zappy_gui -p 4242 -h 127.0.0.1
```
